2016 UCLA Bruin Open {
  Humberto( Loss ) {
    One point after having lost 7 straight.  
    2 smashes to the net.  5 drops to the net.  Focus was very off.
    Continued to try to keep it low and over the net.  
    I was frustrated, but I tired to keep it cool.
    I started to hit shots higher and deep to the back.  During second game it
    worked well.  I won 8 points straight through defending and playing shots
    up; however, I soon then tried to hit the shots down and attack again.  Low
    and behold, I was lsing points very quick again.  I lost my mentallity and
    didn't focus on my shots anymore.  I tried to do something that wasn't
    working again instead of doing what did work.
    
    My observation( 0.5 ) {
      Focus throughout the game;
      Keep playing the shots that work;
      if( shots do not work ) {
        Do something else;
      }
    }
  }
}
